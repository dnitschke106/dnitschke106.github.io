<h1> Side Scroller Adventure Game </h1>
 <p id="finalproject_page_info" > The following game was programmed by my partner Cameron McGurer and I for our CSC106 course, and it was finished on 12/19/2020. The game is similar to a classic side scroller game such as mario. It involves a green block, which is the player, alone with enemies the player has to avoid. To advance to the next level the player must collect the coin on each level. Movement is controlled by the UP, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys on the keyboard. And be careful, if you hit an enemy you are sent back to the beginning!  </p>
